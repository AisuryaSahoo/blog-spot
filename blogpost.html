        <p><span class="f-w-b">Start a blog.</span> If you don't own a blog yet, you need to find the right platform for
            you. There are so many blogging platforms out in the market to choose from such as WordPress, Blogger,
            Tumblr, and Medium, Weebly etc. Try one out; if you are not satisfied with its offered features, then you
            can move to another, there are countless options some are free and some paid.<br><br>
        <p>
            <span class="f-w-b">Pick a topic</span> that you are passionate about. Even if you don't have a passion,
            writing about your daily life can make for a good read, depending how you word it. If you are going to blog
            about what you did today, make it interesting. People are looking for a funny story or your opinion on a
            debatable subject. They may not be as willing to read how you changed a lightbulb today. Using photos can
            help enhance the reading experience and engage readers more.
            Read a lot. This simply means you need to go through other bloggers' posts, which helps to improve your
            writing skills and exposes you to new ways of writing. You must always be a student and ready to learn. You
            can read about topics of your interest.<br><br>

        <p> <span class="f-w-b">Learn about search engine optimization (SEO).</span> The very basics of this is knowing
            which keywords to focus on. These are what people are searching for in the search engines, and how they
            might find your blog. Some of these keywords get a lot more searches than others get, so it's in your best
            interest to eventually choose the ones that do get searched for often. Keep in mind that these are often
            more competitive than ones that are searched for less -- but you might get lucky.</p>
